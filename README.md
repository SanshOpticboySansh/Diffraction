# Diffraction
Physical Optics Diffraction experiments with Python

Files:

coherence_srio_seminar_v3.pdf Slides of my seminar given at ESRF on 7th July 2015

Python scripts: 

airy_profile.py calculates the radial profile of the Airy pattern
fraunhofer.py calculates Fraunhofer diffraction of a 2D aperture
fresnel_fourier_1D.py calculates diffraction in 1D using convolution theorem
fresnel_kirchhoff_1D.py calculates diffraction in 1D using approximated Kirchhoff-Fresnel integral 
polygon.py testing (for including any polygonal aperture using PyMca, under development)
thomson_wolf_1957.py Simulation of the Thomson & Wolff experiment via Kirchhoff-Fresnel integral and ensemble average. 

To do: 
fresnel_fourier_2D.py calculates diffraction in 2D using convolution theorem
fresnel_kirchhoff_2D.py calculates diffraction in 2D using approximated Kirchhoff-Fresnel integral
